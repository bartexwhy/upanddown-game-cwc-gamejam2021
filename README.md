# About
I made this game for CWC: Game Jam 2021. Theme of this game jam was "Modernizing a Classic" so I blended some Pacmam gameplay (collecting something, for my game these are orbs) and some Mario platforming gameplay. All the assets were made by me in Aseprite, sound effects were made in software called sfxr.

# Controls
A, D - move left and right 

R - restart level 

Spacebar - jump (you can double jump) 

LMB (Left Mouse Button) - attack

TAB - pause game


# Source code
You can modify my game if you want but I really don't think anyone would even touch this game.
